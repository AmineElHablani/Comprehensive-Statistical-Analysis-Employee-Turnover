# Comprehensive-Statistical-Analysis-Employee-Turnover

### Abstract
This project delves into a thorough statistical analysis of employee turnover (churn), aiming to uncover significant insights that can guide effective recruitment strategies. By identifying key factors influencing employee retention and those less impactful, the analysis offers valuable guidance for optimizing hiring practices and setting realistic expectations.

Utilizing open-source data from Kaggle, this study applies a range of hypothesis testing methods, including both parametric and non-parametric statistical tests such as t-tests, chi-squared tests, and proportion tests. The findings from this analysis provide actionable insights to enhance decision-making in human resources and refine company strategies.
